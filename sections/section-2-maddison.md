## Actividad 2
I believe that what makes an action right or wrong depends on the final purpose. In this case, I can’t fully define whether it was right or wrong because, in a way, they saved all those women who were being cheated on, but it also didn’t have much of an impact because, in the end, none of those conversations with bots were going to lead anywhere. However, the fact that they exposed the fraud is what ultimately makes it somewhat good, because all those people were being deceived and robbed. But here, we can’t blame just one person, because in the end, all the men who were involved knew what they were doing was wrong, yet they kept doing it. What they didn’t expect was to be exposed in that way, so I would say both sides are to blame.
