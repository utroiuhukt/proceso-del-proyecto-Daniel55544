## Primera Actividad
For me the morality will always depend on which side you see it from. In the case of this reading, the question is raised whether it is moral for Teresa's parents to want to donate their daughter's organs after she was diagnosed with brain death, considering that if they let her live, she would not survive more than two weeks. For this reason, I believe that what the parents chose to do, although it may be painful, is a good action, as it allows them to save the lives of other children who might also have been born with complications but could be saved thanks to Teresa's organs. So, probably from the perspective where you see it as ending a "life," it could be viewed as something wrong, but it can also be seen in the way that they could do nothing and let Teresa's body go through the decomposition process, which could change how things are perceived.
